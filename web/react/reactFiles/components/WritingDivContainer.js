						<h2>Why is there a need to choose</h2>
						<p>What about if every ‘couple’ design their relationship
						 as they want? And change that definition as they change.
						 That means everyone must not be monogamous or polygamous, it means that everyone is willing to everything, depending on what they’re feeling, 
						it is not a binary decision but a matter of level.</p>
						<img src="/static/img/w1.png" alt=""></img>
						<p>For instance, I have the irrational necessity to be cheesy with someone once in a while, one point to prove it is the need to talk about it, I enjoy love as few people do, I like when I ‘fall in love’ with (closer to ‘like’ than to ‘love’) someone, for instance, in this moment (when I wrote this part) the joy that brings hearing the voice of Camila is stupidly heartwarming, but what can I do? (she will bully me so hard if she reads this paragraph) I like feeling the uncertainty of the reciprocal feeling, I like when I feel bad or jealous (as happens with Vanessa), but I love falling in love.But at the same time I hate corny people, and I hate being around them and being one of them. Sometimes I cannot be corny with someone, but I would love to modify space-time to be cheesy with someone else while loving more the one which I’m not cheesy with.</p>
						<p>The complexity of the human feelings is the reason why I think that I like this approach to relationships. We have several necessities at the same time, for instances (a very small list): someone to count on, someone to have fun with, sometimes we need to just think alone or to share philosophical ideas, share something deep with someone or (as happens with me) being cheesy, or even have purely sex. It would be perfect to be able to share all those with the same person, and being realistic it is very hard to have all those items together and in some cases those needs contradict themselves, so it is imposible to have them grouped in one person.</p>
						<img src="/static/img/w2.png" alt=""></img>
						<p>We can have different needs in a point in time, for instance, all those items from the small list can be present at the same time at point B, but through time we could focus on different aspects. We are dynamic animals, some period of times we could be more interesting in someone (funnier) and 4 months later or attention is back to someone else (someone deeper). Those dynamics are so variable than following point C could happen anything, for example wanting to be with that funnier someone for more than 2 years and it does not create any problem to the approach I’m exposing in these notes.</p>

					<h2>About exclusivity</h2>
					<p>Another point necessary to talk about is the exclusivity. Why promise exclusivity to someone? It is in order to reduce the uncertainty and increase the level of the the stability in the relationship, I can think of two cases where that stability is in danger. The first case is very vague, when someone is looking for someone else while she (he) is in an exclusive relationship (being a bitch or a dog so called), in this case the stability is not increased by that promise, whether or not someone goes to look for someone else in her (his) partner’s back is a point about education of that one and not about a promise. The second case I can imagine is the case where someone is not looking for someone else, but she stumbles with someone else, in this case such promise cannot avoid anything and making mandatory to forget about that someone else is just hypocrite and mediocre. So for me, that promise of exclusivity does not depend on oneself but rather to chance or random events (given that being a dog is an unwanted characteristic and she (he) chooses the right person to be with in a relationship).</p>

					<h2>Kids</h2>
					<p>What about kids? can they damage this approach? The case where by having sex she (they) get pregnant has no value added here, it is more interesting to apply this approach to cases where people want to have kids and study whether or not they can stay in an open relationship, that last case add a great value to the discussion.
					So let’s picture a ‘couple’, two persons who follow this approach to social relationship (that could be summarized as open relationship) and at the same time they want to have one kid, that can be translated to ‘create a family’. Now, I like that term (create a family) because it brings to my mind the old closed discussion about homosexual people and adopting children, perhaps this new open relationship and having kids could be the next iscussion.
					So is it possible to be in an open relationship and create a family at the same time? Of course, the first period of the new born both partners have to share a lot of time, but apart from that, the relationship could be seen as the relationship hold by a divorced couple. Bien sûr that there will be some differences with the divorced couple but I don’t see any significant difference that could harm significantly this approach. Case closed.</p>
					</section>

					<h2>The biggest problem (falling in love for real)</h2>
					<p>Will someone who is in love for real with someone else accept this model? That question must be solve before considering this approach as true permanent and useful approach for life and not a small theory for someone just when she/he is not in love.
					Why that someone will accept this model if being in love for real means that she only wants to be with some other person, why accept being in an open relationship?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>obstacles</h2>
						<p>Personally I think this theory faces many challenges in order to be applied to real live and in significant scale.
						Further thoughts.</p>
						<p>Simone de Beauvoir can complement my idea, perhaps reading the second sex could help.</p>
